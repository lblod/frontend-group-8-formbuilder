Restructure snippet editor sidebar intro 3 sections:
- Algemene nodes (General nodes): contains actions such as inserting dates, citations etc.
- Besluit nodes (Decision nodes): contains actions such as inserting a mandatee table, decision article
- Reglementaire Bijlage nodes (Regulatory statement nodes): contains actions such as inserting article structures, document titles

This division should make it easier for the creator of the template to use the editor
